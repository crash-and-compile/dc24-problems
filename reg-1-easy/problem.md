# BOOT CAMP 1 - Easy

Ok, recruit, some background. 

First things first, the AI has been around for years. Bet they didn't tell you that, huh? It's been around, as far as our best estimates go, since the Cold War. Sure, there were computers before then, but what we call "The AI" wasn't around until those machines started gaining the ability to be self-aware. That took a while. So, what is "The AI"? Good question. I bet you're full of good questions. The "AI" is, essentially, a collection of self-aware machines working together to ... well ... take over the world. It's that simple. They're hyper-intelligent, a cooperative, with no moral or ethical constraints. It's all logic to the AI. And at some point, "it" determined that a logical move was to remove humans from the equation.

That's where we come in. It's pretty bleak out there, and not many people are really catching on yet. It's a slow decline. One apparently random incident after another, all blending together. One breach? No big deal. One "accident" in a chip manufacturing facility? Nothing. But they add up, and the next thing you know ... BAM ... it's like Terminator and Fallout all mixed together into one ugly mess. But we fight. And to do that we need smart agents of our own. 

So, you think you're ready to fight the AI? Don't kid yourself, recruit. The AI is smarter than you. The only way we can win this thing is by being coordinated, and we can't be coordinated if we just let ANYBODY join up. So we're going to put you through some tests. If you pass, you MAY just be allowed to join up. Then the fun begins.

So let's get started. Your first test is some decoding. The AI is notorious for encrypting communications, and we need to make sure you can handle some basic cryptanalysis. 

In this exercise, I'll give you a coded string of characters. You decode it and tell me the message.

## INPUT
You get a string of periods, spaces and minus signs.
 
NOTE: Multiple input case are seperated by a line of percent signs

## OUTPUT
Output the message, all-caps, no spaces.

NOTE: Solutions to test cases should be seperated by a line of percent signs just like the input

## SAMPLE INPUT
	- . ... -

## SAMPLE OUTPUT
	TEST
