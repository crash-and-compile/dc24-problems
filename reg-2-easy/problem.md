# BOOT CAMP 2

Welcome to the second part of your boot camp. If you haven't done the first boot camp exercises, you might want to give them a try first. But far be it from me to tell you what to do.

In this section, we're going to focus on Gray codes. What's a Gray? Funny you should ask.

The Gray code is a reflected binary code (RBC), named after Frank Gray. It's a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit. The reflected binary code was originally designed to prevent spurious output from electromechanical switches. Obviously, this type of code is of particular interest to the AI agents that we've encountered in the field, so we tend to make sure our recruits can handle it. It's a good training exercise, and may end up saving some lives down the line, so here we go.

I'm not going to waste time explaining it to you. Go read: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code</a> . That should give you everything you need to know.

## INPUT
I'll give you a decimal representation of a Gray binary constructed from an n-bit Gray code. 

NOTE: Multiple input case are seperated by a line of percent signs

## OUTPUT
You output the decimal value that was encoded.

NOTE: Solutions to test cases should be seperated by a line of percent signs just like the input
