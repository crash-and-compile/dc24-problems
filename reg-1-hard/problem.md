# BOOT CAMP 1 - Hard

Welcome to the advanced course, recruit. You've either passed the previous exercises, or feel you can operate at an advanced level. Good for you, I just hope you're not too full of yourself.

So, again, the AI loves to encode communications. But not everything is a Railfence cipher, sometimes the AI can be downright deceptive. Here's an example from Charlie team that we've been using as a training example. Charlie team was out in the field, collecting data being sent between various AI agents. At first, they couldn't figure out what was going on. It wasn't a lot of data, so they were initially skeptical that cryptanalysis would be useful. Luckily, a new recruit was able to notice what was going on, and helped Charlie get some decent intel. That recruit went through this same boot camp, by the way, so you've got some big shoes to fill.

Turns out, the AI was shifting between 3 different encoding schemes. Once the recruit figured them out, they were able to reliably decode the messages. 

## INPUT
You'll be given an encoded message.

NOTE: Multiple input case are seperated by a line of percent signs

## OUTPUT
Output the decoded message. You'll know if you've got the right decoding scheme for the message.

NOTE: Solutions to test cases should be seperated by a line of percent signs just like the input

## SAMPLE INPUT
	VEVTVA

## SAMPLE OUTPUT
	TEST
