# GET CRACKING!

Thanks to a successful infiltration by Mr. X, we now know that access to the
utility tunnels is controlled by a simple password. Unfortunately, Mr. X was
de-atomized while running the Farrell Freaker(tm) for too many invalid password
attempts. We recorded his attempts, though, and like all good password
crackers, we could see each succesful character as it was tried.

Security has since been tightened and the de-atomizer will now fire for *any*
invalid attempts. As our brightest (and most expendable) recruit, we need you
break the code and lead the charge underground!

## INPUT

matching characters in that attempt.
