# BOOT CAMP 2

Hopefully, you've boned up on your Gray codes, because now we get more serious. Make sure you've familiarized yourself with Gray codes at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code

Gray codes are great for physical switches, but the AI has also repurposed them to encode messages. We think this was initially used to prevent errors in instructions sent to mechanical agents, but who knows, right? Fact is, we've seen this type of encoding used a lot. Just last week, Bravo team was able to get out of a very touchy situation because they decoded a Gray code message sent to an AI assassination unit. True story.

Anyway, now that you know the basics of Gray codes, we'll move on to practical applications.

## INPUT
I'll give you a series of decimal representation of Gray code binary values.

## OUTPUT
Output the encoded message.
