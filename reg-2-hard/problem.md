# BOOT CAMP 2 - Hard

Many of the AI agents we've detected in the wild don't rely on simple bit streams for their C2 channels. Rather, they've got sophisticated visual processing components that can read images and determine what instructions the AI central control is sending out. We've seen Gray codes used for this type of application quite often, and a lot of the times we've seen these instructions embedded into other media. We've seen them embedded in TV commercials, even just a single frame. The agents can spot them, and they know what to do.  

Anyway, let's get to it. Time to see if you're as good as some of the AI agents... 

## INPUT
You'll get a bunch of text. This is a Base64-encoded PNG image file. Your job is to process the image file and determine what was encoded. 

NOTE: Multiple input case are seperated by a line of percent signs

## OUTPUT
We'll keep this simple. The image encodes 4 characters

NOTE: Solutions to test cases should be seperated by a line of percent signs just like the input
